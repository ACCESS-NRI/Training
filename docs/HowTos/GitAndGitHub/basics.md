Git is the industry standard for version control. Numerous tools have been developed to support code management using Git. These tools make it faster and more user-friendly to manage code using industry's best practice. As such, knowing to use Git is very valuable to anyone developing code.

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. Using GitHub or other similar platforms with Git for your code development allows you to safely back up your code and to open your work to collaboration.

This how-to focuses on using both Git and GitHub together for code development and collaboration.

## Graphical clients and IDE

Interacting with Git can be a lot easier through GUIs or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) rather than remembering a list of commands for the command-line.

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): the best Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tool currently. It includes full coding support for about all coding languages, including Fortran. It integrates with Git, GitHub, BitBucket and GitLab through various extensions.

[SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/): A free powerful GUI for Git on Mac and Windows. 

[Other GUIs](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis): A list of GUIs for Git from the Git documentation.
