Numerous tools have been developed to support code management using Git. These tools make it faster and more user-friendly to manage code using industry's best practice. As such, knowing to use Git is very valuable to anyone developing code. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. Using GitHub or other similar platforms with Git for your code development allows you to safely back up your code and to open your work to collaboration. This how-to focuses on using both Git and GitHub together for code development and collaboration. A quick introduction A quick introduction of using Git and GitHub showing how to record your work with Git and connect with GitHub. A typical Git/GitHub workflow A short video presenting a typical Git/GitHub workflow based on the most used Git commands.

To go to the essential only: Learn how to edit files directly on GitHub Learn how to set up SSH authentification Learn about pull requests . It includes information about the text formatting used on GitHub, Markdown.

Two-factor authentication We recommend to enable 2-factor authentication on your GitHub account for higher security. SSH authentification ACCESS users are used to SSH for connecting to NCI. We recommend setting up SSH keys for pulling from and pushing to GitHub repositories. Remember to set a passphrase for your key, do not use passphrase-less keys. Use SSH agent forwarding to securely forward ssh keys from your own machine to use them on NCI machines. Commit signature verification It is trivially easy to impersonate another user when committing to git. This does not lead to elevated privileges, but could be exploited in a social hack, causing commits to be accepted based on an assumption of identity. Code signing gives others confidence that code commits come from a trusted source . Code signing is not required to contribute to ACCESSHub, but it is for contributing to most repositories in the ACCESS-NRI Organisation . GitHub is the code hosting platform used by ACCESS-NRI, and GitHub supports code signing. You know when a commit is correctly signed because the commit has a \"Verified\" badge: Signing code with SSH keys Code signing with GPG has been supported for some time, but it is somewhat complicated to configure and places a burden to become familiar with and maintain GPG keys. Since version 2.34.0 git supports code signing with ssh keys. Most people are familiar with using ssh keys for ssh access, which makes configuring code signing more straightforward. Info git 2.37.3 is available as a module on gadi ( module load git/2.37.3 ) First add your signing key to GitHub . Either use an existing SSH key, or create a new one. Make sure your key is on your keychain and then login to gadi with key forwarding. Info Adding a key to your ssh agent is platform dependent Apple OSX: ssh-add --apple-use-keychain <path to keychain> Linux : ssh-add <path to keychain> To automatically sign all commits and tags in all repositories with your ssh key: git config --global commit.gpgsign true git config --global tag.gpgsign true git config --global gpg.format ssh git config --global user.signingKey <ssh public key signature> Note Ensure you use a modern enough version of git otherwise you will get errors if you try and sign commits Resources https://blog.dbrgn.ch/2021/11/16/git-ssh-signatures/ https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key#telling-git-about-your-ssh-key https://calebhearth.com/sign-git-with-ssh","title":"GitHub setup"},{"location":"HowTos/GitAndGitHub/github_setup/#github-setup","text":"We present here our recommended setup for GitHub.","title":"GitHub setup"},{"location":"HowTos/GitAndGitHub/github_setup/#two-factor-authentication","text":"We recommend to enable 2-factor authentication on your GitHub account for higher security.","title":"Two-factor authentication"},{"location":"HowTos/GitAndGitHub/github_setup/#ssh-authentification","text":"ACCESS users are used to SSH for connecting to NCI.
